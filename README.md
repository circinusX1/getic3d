###  Design a 3D model.
##### Tips:  
   * Seal your design. 
   * The 3D map has to be water-sealed by a hallo reverse cube or cube shell.
   * Usually you create hallo shapes, join them side by side overlapping walls then create holes in the wals using cut all brushes.
   * Make sure there is no hole to outside. CHeck the bottom of this readme for details.

## How to.
As I dont have any Windows machines anymore and this was writen in old times using 
C++ MFC and Visual studio I am left with a prebuild version since. This short tutorial follows
howto for Linux. I started a port to QT thouhg few years ago, aka see: qgetic but I did not have 
time to finish it. In windows, I dont know if still runs, but under Linux using wine looks like is working.

  * Clone the git
