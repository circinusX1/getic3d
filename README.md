###  Design a 3D model.
##### Tips:  
   * Seal your design. 
   * The 3D map has to be water-sealed by a hallo reverse cube or cube shell.
   * Usually you create hallo shapes, join them side by side overlapping walls then create holes in the wals using cut all brushes.
   * Make sure there is no hole to outside. CHeck the bottom of this readme for details.
