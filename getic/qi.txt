1.How do you decide which integer type to use? 
    Integer is a fundamental type. jou just use it
    The question has to be reformulated.

2.What should the 64-bit integer type on new, 64-bit machines be?
    By compiler. if compiler tests the platform will do the int 64 bits

3.What’s the best way to declare and define global variables? 
    At the top of the file.

4.What does extern mean in a function declaration? 
    Implememnted in another unit code

5.What’s the auto keyword good for?

6.I can’t seem to define a linked list node which contains a pointer to itself. 
    Definitions are used to define. A pointer is an instance of a defined entity.
    An instance of a node can point to itself but the question is wrong formulated.
    
7.How do I declare an array of N pointers to functions returning pointers to functions returning pointers to characters? 
    ((char(*)()) (*)())[N]

8.How can I declare a function that returns a pointer to a function of its own type? 


    

9.My compiler is complaining about an invalid redeclaration of a function, but I only define it once and call it once. What’s happening? 
10.What can I safely assume about the initial values of variables which are not explicitly initialized? 
11.Why can’t I initialize a local array with a string? 
12.What is the difference between char a[] = “string"; and char *p = “string"; ? 
13.How do I initialize a pointer to a function?
